# Theory Assignment:
# ● - What is `NPM`?
# -------- NPM manages packages in our projects. Its abbrevation is not node package manager.

# ● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
# -------- Parcel and Webpack are JavaScript bundlers that transform, optimize, 
# and bundle your code and assets for the browser.

# we need it----
# Combine multiple files into a single bundle for efficiency.
# Transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript into browser-compatible versions.
# Minify and optimize the code.
# Handle assets like images, stylesheets, and fonts.
# Improve development workflows through features like live reloading and hot module replacement.

# ● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
# -- .gitignore is a file that is not pushed on git. The files that we want not to have on
#  git then we can add that file or folder in gitignore like we did for node_modules folder.

# ● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
# -- node_modules is a folder that containes all the code that we fetch from npm install parcel

# ● - What is `npx` ?
# --- Used to execute any pacakge or dependency that is installed in the app.

# ● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
# -- package.json file basically a config. for our npm. It keeps the track of what 
# versions of package is installed into our app/system 
# while packahe.lock.json file is used to keep the track of exact v ersion of packages or 
# dependencies that is installed in our app

# ● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

# ● - What is `.parcel-cache`
#
